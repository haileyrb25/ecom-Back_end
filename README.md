# Ecom-Back_end

For this challenge, I was able to use Insomnia rest API to create routes to see data in my database. I was able to connect to my DBeaver, seed to data with VS Code, and then route the API's to see them in Insomnia. This challenge was a refactoring challenge; so while we had code to start, this was still a challenge to get up and running. Down below is a screenshot of my final product and also the google drive link to view the live demo.
